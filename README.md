# Loops-in-C-plus-plus


Overview:
In C++, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. They are essential in controlling the flow of programs, especially when performing repetitive tasks such as iterating through arrays, processing input, or executing logic multiple times.
Common types of loops include:
for loop – iterates a fixed number of times
while loop – continues as long as a condition is true
do-while loop – executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition (not available in all languages)

Theory:
1. For Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.
2. While Loop
Used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.
3. Do-While Loop 
Runs at least once regardless of the condition.

Loop Control Statements in C++:
break – Terminates the loop prematurely
continue – Skips the current iteration and moves to the next
goto – Jumps to a labeled statement (not recommended for regular loop control)

Program Analysis:

1. Print 'SIT' 5 times
   Demonstrates a simple for loop which print "SIT" 5 times each in new line.

2. Print Even numbers from 0 to 10
   Uses conditional logic and controlled incrementing inside the loop and printseven numbers from 0 to 10.

3. Validating password from user by while loop.(a working login page)
   This program demonstrates user input validation and multiple loop exits by taking input from user validating via "if condition" .

4.Print Digits in reverse order of a number
   Uses for loop with modulus and division to reverse digits and print them in new line each based on number.

5. Nested for Loop
   Demonstrates nested loop control which shows how outer loop runs first for first iteration then moves to inner loop and moves back to outer one.

6.Printing Star pattern
   Builds a basic triangle shape using stars and prints them left aligned .

7. Printing Reverse Star pattern
   Combines spacing and star printing for alignment and aligns pattern right side.

8. Floyds Series
  This program prints numbers in ascending order as per the series each in new line using nested for loop.

9. Hourglass Pattern
    This program prints a symmetric hourglass pattern with the help of teo for loops each used to print the upward and downward triangle respectively.

Conclusion:
Loops in C++ are powerful tools that simplify repetitive tasks, enhance logic control, and improve code readability. Mastering loops (along with control statements like break and continue) is essential for writing efficient and dynamic C++ programs. Whether you’re iterating through data, checking conditions, or building algorithms — loops are at the heart of C++ programming.
